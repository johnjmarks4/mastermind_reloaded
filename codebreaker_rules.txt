OK, here are the rules for the codebreaker:

The computer will randomly select a four color pattern like this: "Red, Green, Orange, Yellow". Your job is try to guess all four colors and the order they occur in. Each turn you'll get some feedback on how you are doing:

1. If you guess the correct color but the wrong place, the word "white" will appear.

2. If you guess both the color and the place correctly, the word "black" will appear.

3. If you've gotten neither right, that place in the code will remain blank.

Use the feeback to improve on your past guesses and gradually unravel the code. If you fail to guess the correct color pattern after 12 turns, you lose; but if you guess the correct colors and order you win!

Now make your first guess! The colors you have are: red, green, blue, purple, orange, and yellow.
